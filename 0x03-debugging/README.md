# C - Debugging

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about what is debugging.

## Debugging

Is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as `gdb` or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

## Files

All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C.
