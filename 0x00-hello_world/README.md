# C - Hello, World

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn **about:**

* What is entry point.
* Basics commands (`puts`, `printf`, `putchar`, ... ).
* How to compile using `gcc`.
* What is the default program name when compiling with `gcc`.
* What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with `betty-style`.
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function.

## Files

All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C.

> * [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/Moh-A-Mahdi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)
>
>> A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
>>>
>>> * _The C file name will be saved in the variable_ `$CFILE`.
>>> * _The output is saved in the file_ `c`.
